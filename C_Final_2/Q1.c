/*
1. Write a C program that takes an integer from the user and determines whether the number is even or odd.
Description: The program should prompt the user to enter a whole number. It must then check if the number is perfectly divisible by 2. If it is, the program should display that the number is even; otherwise, it should display that the number is odd. The program should handle both positive and negative integers. Pre-requisites: Conditional Statements, Operators.
